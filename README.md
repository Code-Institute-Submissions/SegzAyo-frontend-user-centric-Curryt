Features
The pages featured on this website are: Home, Menu, About-Us and Reservation page.
The home page has a landing image banner showing the beautiful set up and ambience of the restaurant, below the landing is a welcome message and images showing the categories on the menu of the restaurant. Also on the homepage are buttons for intending visitors to place reservations.
The about-us page features a brief history and information about the restaurant, a brief bio of the head chef is also featured on this page to help convince undecided customers.
On the menu page are names and images of all the cuisines served at Curryt and also a reservation button.
The reservation page is a form that collects the name of the customer, date, time and number of people visiting the restaurant. This information also helps the restaurant prepare to provide the best possible service. Once the form is filled and submitted, a confirmation message is displayed for the user to know the booking was successful.
The Navigation bar helps to move from one page to another while the footer contains contact information, opening hours and a brief information of Curryt. Both the navigation bar and footer are consistent across all the pages. 
Features Left to Implement
I created a video I was supposed to use as background instead of the current homepage banner.
The confirmation page was intended to be a pop-up message box instead of a full page.
Submission button is not linking to the confirmation page.
